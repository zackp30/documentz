1. **Don't be overly offensive, or otherwise nasty**.
    - If somebody is asking you to stop saying something to them, do so, they're obviously considering it too offensive.

2. **Be respectful**
   - **No discrimination**
       - Racism
       - Transphobia
       - Homophobia
       - Sexism
       - etc
